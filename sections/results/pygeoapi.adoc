===== Extension of Records with PROV using pygeo templates

Pygeoapi's template system was extended to support provenance traces.

Provenance metadata is naturally is a directed acyclic graph (DAG) of arbitrary depth and detail.

A simple catalog test case was established using the provenance model and the schema from https://ogcincubator.github.io/bblock-prov-schema/bblock/ogc.ogc-utils.prov.

A generalized provenance rendering template was then referenced when rendering a standardized property (_provenance_) configured to understand the high level abstract typing of Entity, Activity and Agent, and recursively nest content. (https://github.com/MarkusWilhelmJahn/pygeoapi/blob/master/CODESPRINT/prov_recursive.html)

This successfully presented such a provenance graph as shown:

This has three significant implications for considering metadata standardization:

. A rich provenance model can be handled with current reference implementation software and hence there is no substantial technical barrier;
. Well-known metadata extensions can be supported using well-known attachment properties, which will be necessary for each object type (record, feature etc); and
. Well-known schemas will be required to to allow predictable behavior given the inherent complexity of some types of metadata.

It is also worth noting that a scalable solution will probably require more dynamic UI filtering, and can load referenced objects that are not directly embedded in the results.

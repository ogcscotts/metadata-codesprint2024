==== OGC API - Features

The https://ogcapi.ogc.org/features[OGC API - Features] Standard offers the capability to create, manage, and query spatial data on the Web. The Standard specifies requirements and recommendations for Web APIs that are designed to facilitate the sharing of feature data. The specification is a multi-part standard. Part 1, labeled the Core, describes the mandatory capabilities that every implementing service has to support and is restricted to read-access to spatial data that is referenced to the World Geodetic System 1984 (WGS 84) Coordinate Reference System (CRS) (<<OGC17-069r4>>). Part 2 enables the use of different CRSs, in addition to the WGS 84 (<<OGC18-058r1>>). Additional capabilities that address specific needs will be specified in additional parts. Envisaged future capabilities include, for example, support for creating and modifying data, more complex data models, and richer queries.

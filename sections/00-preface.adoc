=== Abstract
The Metadata Code Sprint was planned to have a primary focus on the following group of tools, APIs and encodings.

OGC GeoDCAT  – (under development) a spatio-temporal profile of the W3C DCAT Recommendation DCAT, and provide guidance about its use and further specialization. OGC GeoDCAT is inspired by the GeoDCAT-AP specification but defines just the internationally relevant concepts to allow wider application. The key areas to consider are around the expression of place and time, such as GeoDCAT-AP properties-for-location

OGC API – Records provides a way to browse or search a curated collection of records of geospatial resources, known as a catalog. A record makes a resource discoverable by providing summary information (e.g. metadata) about the geospatial resource.

ISO 19115 Standards define the schema required for describing geographic information and services by means of metadata. Of particular interest will be recent developments on JSON encodings provided by ISO 19115-4.

STAC provides a common structure for describing and cataloging spatiotemporal assets. A spatiotemporal asset is any file that represents information about the earth captured in a certain space and time.

Other metadata standards, such as CDIF, EML, and Local Context may be included where the use of these have important implications on the utility of geospatial metadata.

Particular focus will be placed on use of OGC modular “building blocks for location” that address both simple and the most complex use-cases.

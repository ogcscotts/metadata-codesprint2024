=== Describing Provenance with OGC API Records

OGC has been exploring the use of reusable building blocks to enable elements of standards to be re-used, extended, and modified with a FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) way. A focus of this code sprint was around extension of various standards to include provenance information.

A draft JSON schema based on the W3C Provenance Vocabulary (PROV-O) was available for testing.

The following research questions

. Can we create machine-readable provenance chains to enable scientific data re-creation?
. Can generate of such machine-readable provenance chains be automatable in scientific workflows?
. Can such provenance chains be exploited in current technology
